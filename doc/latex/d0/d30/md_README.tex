Almost the single most overkill version of a quadratic root finder I could think of. I could also add the quadratic functions to a polynomial struct with function pointers ({\itshape i.\+e.}, as methods) to make this unnecessarily object oriented, but that might be best left to the user as an exercise.

You will note that I include \href{https://doxygen.nl/}{\texttt{ Doxygen}}-\/style documentation and it is tooled for the usual gcc/cmake workflow. It\textquotesingle{}s aching to use github actions as a build system.

I made this as a reference program to highlight a bunch of common {\ttfamily C} ideas. There are preprocessor macros, static functions, standard librarys, command line arguments, etc. etc.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Build Instructions}\label{md_README_autotoc_md1}
Since this is intended as a simple reference for undergraduate students, I intended this to be built and used in your favorite $\ast$nix flavor. These instructions will cover installing, building, and running the program in \href{https://www.debian.org/}{\texttt{ Debian}} on Windows via \href{\#install-wsl}{\texttt{ WSL}}. You could achieve the same in Windows with \href{https://www.mingw-w64.org/}{\texttt{ mingw}}, or even easier to do it on a native \href{https://ubuntu.com/download}{\texttt{ Linux}} device or mac\+OS.

\label{_install-wsl}%
\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Installing WSL if you are using Windows}\label{md_README_autotoc_md2}
Consult the \href{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install}{\texttt{ official install docs}} if you run into trouble.

First, fire open Command Prompt (search for it in your Start menu) or Power\+Shell, or even better, Terminal, and install debian via wsl


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{wsl -\/-\/install -\/d Debian}

\end{DoxyCode}


Alternatively, try out ubuntu if you prefer the bleeding edge


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{wsl -\/-\/install -\/d Debian}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Installing the build tools and such}\label{md_README_autotoc_md3}
Assuming you are staring at a Debian-\/based Linux prompt, you should probably get up to date


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo apt update}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo apt upgrade -\/y}

\end{DoxyCode}


and now install all the magic sauce


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo install git cmake vim}

\end{DoxyCode}


If you like Visual Studio Code instead of vim (heathen) then you can install on native Debian-\/based via {\ttfamily snap} with


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo snap install -\/-\/classic code}

\end{DoxyCode}


or follow the \href{https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux}{\texttt{ instructions}} to install via apt (I prefer it this way). If you are using WSL, there are \href{https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl}{\texttt{ instructions}} for that too.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{Building the code}\label{md_README_autotoc_md4}
Now that you are all set up, and assuming you have \href{https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent}{\texttt{ generated an SSH key}} and \href{https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account}{\texttt{ added it to your github account}}, first clone the repo


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{git clone git@github.com:jacobw56/quadratic\_formula.git}

\end{DoxyCode}


then make a build folder and build it


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd quadratic\_formula}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdir build}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd build}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake ..}
\DoxyCodeLine{make}

\end{DoxyCode}


Now try it out!


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./quadratic\_formula -\/A=2.34 -\/B=7 -\/C=-\/4.51}

\end{DoxyCode}


or


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./quadratic\_formula -\/-\/help}

\end{DoxyCode}
